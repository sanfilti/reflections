How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Enabled me to see where the differences actually were instead of having to manually searcg for it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Allow me to see the changes ast a quick glance and determine wheat those changes may have affected.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - Ability to decide for yourself when a save if commiteted.
    Cons - Possibility of not saving and losing informstion.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    GIT tracks changes for multiple files at once since multiple files might be interrelated and require 
    that they be restored to the same time frame.
    Google docs handles each file as a separate file and therefore doesn't track

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to show the commits and git diff to show the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Gives the ability to quickly test and roll back changes withour affeecting the end code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Tracking changes to any coding that I am working on.
