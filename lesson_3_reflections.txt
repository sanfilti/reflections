When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Create a remote repository when you want someone to collaborate with on your work.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 	forks - only done from GitHub to GitHub repositories.  Same as clone.
 	clone - can be done local to local, local to remote and remote to local.   Makes exact
 	copy of a repository.
 	branches - can be done on local and remote repositories.  Creates a new branch of the existing repository
 	and allows for testing of new features/bug fixes/etc without changing the existing
 	branch.
