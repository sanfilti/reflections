When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Create a remote repository when you want someone to collaborate with on your work.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

  Manually pulling changes assures that you get only the changes that you want, and not any commits that might 
  simply be testing commits.
