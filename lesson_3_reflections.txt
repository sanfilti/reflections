When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Create a remote repository when you want someone to collaborate with on your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

  Manually pulling changes assures that you get only the changes that you want, and not any commits that might 
  simply be testing commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 	forks - only done from GitHub to GitHub repositories.  Same as clone.
 	clone - can be done local to local, local to remote and remote to local.   Makes exact
 	copy of a repository.
 	branches - can be done on local and remote repositories.  Creates a new branch of the existing repository
 	and allows for testing of new features/bug fixes/etc without changing the existing
 	branch.
